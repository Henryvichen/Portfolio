    <article class="About">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have always been intrigued by technology, growing up I found myself always immersed in all kinds of electronics; Computers, phones, gaming consoles, you name it! 
      I also love playing games on my down time, but I also realized I spent more hours in the editor of games than the game itself! Thats when it hit me that my true passion was to create things.</p>
      <p>The feeling of watching something you create come to fruition.. Nothing beats that for me! (Except for when you get to create and celebrate together with others!)</p>
        
      </p>
      <p> This led me to become a student at Thinkful, where I learn more about being a software engineer everyday and honestly I couldn't be more satisfied!</p>
      <p>If you are looking to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hire a new Software Engineer</li>
      <li>Looking to find a partner for some gaming sessions</li>
        <li>Or just want a new person to discuss technology with! </li>
     <p> Please feel free to reach out! I promise I won't disappoint! </p>
